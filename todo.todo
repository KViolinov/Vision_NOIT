- To switch to the new version of google.genai - Works for now?
- Test the settings page - sometimes lags (needs more investigation)
- Add login/sign up button on profile picture
- To make it so i can "interrupt" Slavi with a keyboard shortcut

# IN PROGRESS
- To make Slavi not so robot-ick. More human-ish.
- Instagram Audio Calling - needs more work.

# DONE
- Mute/Unmute button/shortcut
- [VisionUI] Switching to state: answering - it kind of works, not perfect.
